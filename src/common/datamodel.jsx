It provides public education in Fire Prevention, Portable Fire Extinguisher use and Smoke Detectors.The site gets updated every day with new events and membership. The main challenging part was the membership area based on custom roles. Though, drupal comes up with some modules for this but needed a lot of customizations. So we decided to develop our own module. We learned a lot more about drupal from this project. Thanks to Darryl and Monsterweb for all their support and help to develop this awesome site.',

Some feature addition and bug fixes are under progress as well. The main challenging task was to handle hundreds of different user schemas. A relational database with fully normalized schema and its handling to frontend led us the perfection and confidence that we can develop any size of application. We never missed the flow of data so never got into problem of data asynchronization. We are proud of Mr. Manoj Roka for such an amazing project management handling and flow follow in every step of development.',

At the time of development of the site, Magento 2 was just released and we were very friendly with Magento 1 only. There were so many changes in Magento 2. But we finished with all the features that we promised and delivered the site in time. We are now in love with Magento2 and suggest all our clients running Magento 1 to move to Magento 2. They have so many improvements, features and bug fixes. We also had to develop two custom magento 2 modules to override the shipping cost calculation update. Client wanted to handle the shipping cost to flat and percentage both based on the location. This was successfully done and working fine. They are very happy with our work. This was done on behalf of one of our main partner agency.',

There are so many APIs used that fetch the real-time dynamic content. Before we start the work, the site was very worse looking in terms of not properly matching the color of logo and other colors. We carefully handled to make the better visual experience. The client had to manually synchronize the third party and own tours if anything was changed. There were so many issues of tours duplication and broken page link. We studied in deep about the whole process flow and managed the data sync between our database and API. The sync is made auto via running the cron jobs. He will no longer have to manually click the sync button to update the tours information. We introduced the lazy loading, ajax pagination etc so that user will never have to feel the performance issue.',
